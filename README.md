# Incremental-PCA
Check out how i observed that from the last project using the incremental pca that i can remove so many more dimensions and keep so much of its variance

This project demonstrates how to apply **Incremental PCA (IPCA)** on the MNIST dataset to reduce dimensionality while preserving 95% of the variance.

MNIST images are 28Ã—28 grayscale images (784-dimensional). Using Incremental PCA, we reduce this high-dimensional data to **154 dimensions**, which captures about **95%
